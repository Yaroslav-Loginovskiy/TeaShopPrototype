# TeaShopPrototype
A small prototype of tea shop using OOP  
**TeaShop Prototype**
Short description consists of three parts: 
1. The first part is choosing some products
2. The second part will be placing orders from the shopping list to the shopping basket.
3. The third part is payment for orders    
<br>The main idea of this project is to show three principles of object oriented programming in simple example. By the way, in this project I use HashMap data structure to simulate a small repository to storage some data.
With help of the abstract class, I reduced the amount of code in derived classes and it helped me use the polymorphism and inheritance principles in my application. Going further, the dependency injection helped me to make some simple dependencies between Client class and class-repository, due to this I was able to use repository-class members in Client class.
Using the encapsulation principle my models won't be accessible from the external world, so due to getting values of private fields, I defined getter methods.
